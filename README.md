2. **What is the role of a service in nodejs server architecture?** *=> 2 points*
 - [ ] Get the request from the router, treat the request parameters, prepare the response of the server to the consumer
 - [X] Keep state of a specific logic portion of the system, provide processing of the data passed from the different controllers, parse the data and returned the processed response
 - [ ] To be the first element in the system that should service the consumer for his CRUD request to the server

## Section B: Please, explain the following terms the best way you can *=> 22 points*

11. **Authentication & Authorization** *=> 7 points*

 Authentication & Authorization - first comes authentication, then authorization.

Stored procedure is a database object, a set of SQL statements which is compiled once and stored on the server.

13. **Git rebase** *=> 4 points*

Git rebase - one of the ways in git to combine the changes of two branches. Rebase compresses all changes into one patch and then integrates the patch into the target branch. Unwanted history is removed in the process.

14. **Generics** *=> 4 points*

Generics - the ability to create components that work not only with one data type. Generics allow to create reusable components that work with different types of data passed to them

15. **Middleware** *=> 4 points*

Middleware is a binding software that helps an application and a server communicate with each other.
 
## Part II: Practice on paper *=> 45 points*

*No restrictions on online resources usage. You also may use your development machine for assistance in debugging if needed.*

16. **You received a bug stating the following: "Intermittently the following method results in a system getting stuck." You're required to find and fix the problem in this method:** *=> 10 points*

		public static addMonths(date: Date, value: number): Date {
		    let expectedMonth: number = date.getMonth() + value;
		    if (expectedMonth > 12) {
		        expectedMonth = expectedMonth % 12;
		    }
    
		    if (expectedMonth < 0) {
		        expectedMonth += 12;
	        }
    
		    date.setMonth(date.getMonth() + value);
	        const daysToAdd: number = date.getMonth() >  expectedMonth ? -1 : 1;
	        while (date.getMonth() !== expectedMonth) {
		        date.setDate(date.getDate() + daysToAdd);
		    }
    
		    return  date;
	    }



		public static addMonths(date: Date, value: number): Date {
    		let expectedMonth: number = date.getMonth() + value;
    		if (expectedMonth > 11) { 
        		expectedMonth = expectedMonth % 12;
    		}

    		if (expectedMonth < 0) {
        		expectedMonth += 12;
   		 	}

    		date.setMonth(date.getMonth() + value);
    		const daysToAdd: number = date.getMonth() >  expectedMonth ? -1 : 1;
    		while (date.getMonth() !== expectedMonth) {
        		date.setDate(date.getDate() + daysToAdd);
    		}

    		return  date;
		}


17. **Having the following DB tables diagram:** *=> 10 points*

![](https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam/blob/dev/resources/db-relations.jpg)

You need to write a query that returns for each student his/her parents' information/ Take into consideration that the amount of parents for the child can be different ("Orphan" comment should appear for any child that has no parents defined in the tables). The data should be returned in the following manner:

| Student | Parents |
| --- | --- |
| John Doe | Mark Doe (09-1231231), Jane Doe (09-4132123) |
| Mary Smith | Klark Smith (07-2134897) |
| Patrice Raymond | Orphan |

SELECT first_name.student, last_name.student, first_name.parent, last_name.parent, phone.parent FROM parent LEFT JOIN 
student ON parent.id = student.id;

18. **Write a method in JS/TS that gets as an argument an array of numbers and returns the sum of all array members**. *=> 5 points*

 public static sumArrayNumbers(array: number[]): number {
        let sum = 0;
        if (array.length > 0) sum = array.reduce((prev, curr) => prev + curr);
        return sum;
    } 

19. **Explain the following piece of code:** *=> 5 points*

		public static padLeft(input: number, places: number): string {
			const zeroes: number = places - input.toString().length + 1;
			return Array(+(zeroes > 0 && zeroes)).join("0") + input.toString();
		}

The method padLeft gets as arguments numbers (input and places) and returns a string. 
At first const zeroes (which is a number) is created. This const is equal to the argument "places" minus the length of input which is converted to string plus 1.
The array with empty values is returned joined in a string with 0 separator and to this string is concatenated the argument "input" converted to the string. If there are zeroes and they are more than 0 the number of empty values in array is a number of zeroes

20. **Fix the following code and fill the required gaps in it by the coding standards. The purpose of this code is to verify the user is a member of a specific role and in case the user is the user data is returned by the isUserPermitted() method. Treat the comments as actual code written that should not be changed:** *=> 15 points*

		interface user {
			id: number;
			firstName: string;
			lastName: string;
		}
		
		interface dbUser {
			id: number;
			first_name: string;
			last_name: string;
		}
		
		interface role {
			id: number;
			userIds: number[];
		}
		
		interface dbRole {
			id: number;
			user_id: number;
		}
		
		public isUserPermitted(userId: number, roleId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				Promise.all([
					this.getUser(userId),
					this.getRole(roleId)
				])
				.then((results: [user | role]) => {
					return results[1].userIds.indexOf(results[0].id) > -1;
					resolve(results[0]);
				});
			});
		}
		
		private getUser(userId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the user data by id as dbUser or null
			});
		}
		
		private getRole(roleId: number): Promise<role> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the role data by id as array of dbRole or null
			});
		}






		interface user {
			id: number;
			firstName: string;
			lastName: string;
		}

		interface dbUser {
			id: number;
			first_name: string;
			last_name: string;
		}

		interface role {
			id: number;
			userIds: number[];
		}

		interface dbRole {
			id: number;
			user_id: number;
		}
		class Service {
			public isUserPermitted(userId: number, roleId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				Promise.all([
					this.getUser(userId),
					this.getRole(roleId)
				])
				.then((results: [user , role]) => {
					const isUserFoundInRolesArray = results[1].userIds.indexOf(results[0].id) > -1;
					if (isUserFoundInRolesArray) resolve(results[0])
					else reject('No permission');
				});
			});
		}

		private getUser(userId: number): Promise<user> {
			return new Promise<user>((resolve, reject) => {
				// Access to the DB that returns the user data by id as dbUser or null

					result = this.parseDbUser(dbUser);
			resolve(result);
				});
			}

			
## Part III: Practice on dev machine *=> 33 points*

 - Clone the repository: https://github.com/lentyaishe/masa-exam;
 - Switch to `broken-server` branch;
 - Create a new git repository under your personal Github called `masa-exam`;
 - Load the `main` branch of your new repository with the contents of the `broken-server` branch;
 - Each bug in the list should be solved in designated branch.

The following is the list of currently existing problems with the system. :

21. **The server solution cannot be compiled. Fix all compilation issues accordingly.** *=> 10 points*

22. **An attempt to get a list of board types fails.** *=> 5 points*

23. **Any request to the server returns: "A token is required for authentication" even in case the token is supplied for the request.** *=> 5 points*

24. **Addition of the new user cannot be performed. Returned error message: "Incorrect query".** *=> 5 points*

25. **On an attempt to add a new board type an error: "not found" is returned.** *=> 8 points*

# Good luck!!
